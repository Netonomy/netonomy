## 🔎 What is the point of decentralized identifiers ?

The point of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) is to provide a new type of identifier that is created, owned, and controlled by the subject of the identifier (e.g., a person, organization, or device) without relying on a central authority or intermediary.

The main benefits of DIDs are:

**User Control**: The user has full control over their DID and the associated data, which gives them more privacy and autonomy.

**Interoperability**: DIDs can be used across different systems and platforms, which can simplify the user experience.

**Security**: DIDs can be more secure than traditional identifiers because they are not tied to a central database that could be hacked.

**Verifiable Credentials**: DIDs can be used in conjunction with verifiable credentials to enable trusted digital interactions.

In summary, the main point of DIDs is to give users more control over their digital identities and to enable trusted digital interactions without relying on central authorities.
